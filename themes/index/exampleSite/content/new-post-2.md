In this post, we'll explore various formatting options available in Markdown.

## Emphasis

You can emphasize text using _italic_ or **bold** styles.

## Quotes

Markdown allows you to include block quotes. Here's an example:

> "The only way to do great work is to love what you do." - Steve Jobs

## Images/Figures

You can include images as figure in your posts. Here's an example:

{{< figure src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1571328565610-56f07b8bf3ce" link="https://unsplash.com/photos/s9KlC-kMFtU?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditShareLink" caption="Emergence of Mandakini river from kedar peak" >}}

## Tables

Markdown supports tables. Here's an example:

| Name    | Age |
| ------- | --- |
| John    | 25  |
| Jane    | 30  |
| Michael | 35  |

That's all for now. Happy formatting with Markdown!
