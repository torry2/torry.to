# Introduction

Welcome to my first post! In this post, I will discuss various Markdown features and show you how to use them effectively.

## Headings

You can use headings to structure your content. Here's an example:

### Subheading

## Lists

Markdown supports both ordered and unordered lists. Here are examples of both:

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

- Unordered item 1
- Unordered item 2
- Unordered item 3

## Links

You can create links to external websites or internal pages. Here's an example:

[Visit my website](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-index)

## Code Blocks

Markdown allows you to include code blocks. Here's an example of a code block in JavaScript:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}

greet("John");
```
